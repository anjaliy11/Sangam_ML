## 🧠 About Sangam Platform

**Sangam** is a collaborative digital platform built to empower **interdepartmental communication and cooperation** for government departments such as **Water Supply**, **Gas**, **Electricity**, **Public Works**, and more.

Key objectives of Sangam:

- 👥 Foster collaboration between departments on shared project sites
- 🛠️ Facilitate joint project planning and task scheduling
- 📊 Enable real-time monitoring and transparency
- 🤝 Break silos in urban governance & infrastructure delivery

The **ML module** in this repo powers smart insights, predictions, and anomaly detection to drive data-driven decisions.

## 🧠 ML Module Overview

This repository contains all ML-related models and scripts that support the Sangam platform by enabling predictive intelligence.

### 🔍 Core Models Implemented

- 📉 **Anomaly Detection Model**  
  Detects irregularities in task updates, cost flow, and resource usage — helping departments flag suspicious or inconsistent behavior early.

- 💸 **Cost Optimization Prediction Model**  
  Predicts potential **cost reduction** strategies by analyzing historical project data, resource allocation patterns, and timelines.

- ⏳ **Task Completion Status Predictor**  
  Uses machine learning to forecast whether a task/project is likely to meet its deadline or not — allowing proactive interventions.
